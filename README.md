The application involves the use of virtual environments for audio post-production, specifically the application of filters, volume mixing, and positioning of various sounds on a timeline. The application allows the user to work with two types of audio: the first allows interfacing with sounds already present in the application and pre-recorded, while the second allows the user to record and subsequently upload sounds into the application. In the virtual scene, graphic models associated with specific types of sound will be present: depending on the instrument the user wants to reproduce, the corresponding speaker will be activated, thus providing visual feedback as well as auditory feedback. The goal is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for applying post-production techniques while simultaneously allowing the user to learn the basics of audio processing. The initial choice for the platform is the VR headset. In the absence of the VR headset, the experience would become AR and therefore usable via tablet. The target audience is a prosumer age group between 20 and 30 years old.

HOW TO USE
In order to open the application you have to download the project in your machine, open the project with Unity, and then build it on a VR connected headset (we used Oculus quest 2 for the purpose).
